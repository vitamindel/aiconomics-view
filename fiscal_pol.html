                    <p class="section-description">
                        Fiscal policy is a key instrument used by governments to influence economic activity and ensure stability. By adjusting public spending and taxation, fiscal policy aims to achieve macroeconomic goals such as economic growth, low unemployment, and price stability. It operates through two primary mechanisms: expansionary fiscal policy, which involves increased government spending or tax cuts, and contractionary fiscal policy, which reduces spending or raises taxes. These tools enable governments to respond to economic fluctuations and guide the economy toward sustainable growth.

                    <p class="section-description">
                        Expansionary fiscal policy is typically used during economic downturns to stimulate demand and reduce unemployment. For example, increased spending on infrastructure projects can create jobs, boost consumption, and encourage investment. Similarly, cutting taxes leaves households with more disposable income, further stimulating economic activity. However, this approach can lead to higher government debt if not managed carefully, raising concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability.

                    <p class="section-description">
                        In contrast, contractionary fiscal policy is employed during periods of economic overheating, where demand outpaces supply, leading to inflation. By reducing government spending or increasing taxes, policymakers can curb excessive demand and stabilize prices. While effective in controlling inflation, contractionary measures can slow economic growth and potentially increase unemployment, making it a delicate balancing act.
