                    <p class="section-description">
                        Monetary policy is a crucial tool used by central banks to manage a nation’s economy by controlling the money supply and interest rates. Its primary goals are to stabilize prices, promote economic growth, and achieve full employment. Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, use monetary policy to influence borrowing, spending, and investment, thereby steering the economy through periods of growth and contraction.

                    <p class="section-description">
                        There are two main types of monetary policy: expansionary and contractionary. Expansionary monetary policy is used during economic slowdowns to stimulate growth. By lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply, central banks make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending and investment. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, central banks worldwide adopted expansionary measures to revive their economies. Conversely, contractionary monetary policy is used to combat inflation. By raising interest rates or reducing the money supply, central banks make borrowing more expensive, thereby cooling excessive demand and stabilizing prices.

                    <p class="section-description">
                        Despite its effectiveness, monetary policy has limitations and risks. For example, expansionary measures can lead to excessive borrowing and asset bubbles, while overly tight contractionary policies can stifle growth and increase unemployment. Moreover, the effects of monetary policy are not instantaneous; changes in interest rates often take months to fully impact the economy. Additionally, central banks must coordinate with fiscal policies to ensure a balanced approach to economic management.
