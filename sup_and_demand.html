                        Supply and demand are fundamental concepts in economics that explain how the prices and quantities of goods and services are determined in a market. The law of demand states that, all else being equal, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded by consumers decreases. This is because consumers are less willing or able to buy a product when it becomes more expensive. On the other hand, the law of supply asserts that as the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied by producers also increases, as higher prices provide an incentive for producers to supply more in order to maximize profits.

                    <p class="section-description">
                        The interaction of supply and demand leads to the equilibrium price, where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. At this point, there is no surplus or shortage of goods. If the price is set above the equilibrium price, producers will supply more than consumers are willing to buy, leading to a surplus. Conversely, if the price is set below the equilibrium price, there will be a shortage, as consumers demand more than producers can supply. Market forces typically push the price toward equilibrium, as changes in supply or demand affect both price and quantity.

                    <p class="section-description">
                        Shifts in supply and demand can occur due to factors other than price. A change in consumer preferences, income, or expectations about future prices can cause demand to shift, while factors such as production costs, technology, or availability of inputs can cause supply to shift. For example, if a new technology makes production cheaper, the supply curve shifts to the right, increasing the quantity supplied at a given price. Similarly, an increase in consumer income might lead to higher demand for certain goods, shifting the demand curve to the right.
