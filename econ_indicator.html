                        Fiscal policy is a key instrument used by governments to influence economic activity and ensure stability. By adjusting public spending and taxation, fiscal policy aims to achieve macroeconomic goals such as economic growth, low unemployment, and price stability. It operates through two primary mechanisms: expansionary fiscal policy, which involves increased government spending or tax cuts, and contractionary fiscal policy, which reduces spending or raises taxes. These tools enable governments to respond to economic fluctuations and guide the economy toward sustainable growth.

                        One of the most important indicators is Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country. A growing GDP typically signals a robust economy, while a shrinking GDP may indicate a recession. Another key indicator is the unemployment rate, which reflects the percentage of people actively seeking work but unable to find employment. High unemployment often points to economic distress, whereas low unemployment suggests stability. Inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), tracks changes in the price of goods and services over time, providing insight into purchasing power and the cost of living.

                        Economic indicators are not without their challenges. For instance, GDP growth might fail to capture income inequality or environmental degradation, which can skew perceptions of economic progress. Similarly, unemployment rates might overlook underemployment or individuals who have stopped searching for work, leading to an incomplete picture of labor market conditions. To address these limitations, analysts often use a combination of indicators to gain a comprehensive understanding of economic dynamics.
