                    <p class="section-description">
                        Market structures form the backbone of economic systems, shaping how goods and services are produced, priced, and distributed. They range from highly competitive setups, such as perfect competition, to less competitive ones, like monopolies. Each structure is defined by factors such as the number of firms in the market, the level of product differentiation, and the ease of entry for new businesses. Understanding these structures is vital for analyzing economic behavior and developing policies to ensure efficient markets and consumer welfare.

                    <p class="section-description">
                        In a perfectly competitive market, numerous small firms sell identical products, and no single firm has significant market power. Prices are determined by supply and demand, fostering efficiency and optimal resource allocation. In contrast, monopolistic competition involves many firms offering similar but differentiated products, such as restaurants or clothing brands. This structure encourages innovation and variety but often leads to higher prices as firms invest in marketing and brand loyalty.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        At the opposite end of the spectrum are oligopolies and monopolies. Oligopolies consist of a few dominant firms, such as in the automobile or telecommunications industries, often leading to collaboration or price-setting behaviors that reduce competition. Monopolies, where a single firm controls the market, can result in high prices and reduced consumer choice. While some monopolies, like utility providers, are government-regulated to protect consumers, unregulated monopolies can exploit their market power.
