                    <p class="section-description">
                        Behavioral economics is a field that combines insights from psychology and economics to explore how people make decisions in real-world settings. Unlike traditional economic theories, which assume that individuals act rationally to maximize their utility, behavioral economics recognizes that human behavior is often influenced by cognitive biases, emotions, and social factors. This approach provides a more nuanced understanding of economic choices, helping to design policies and strategies that align with actual human behavior.

                        One key concept in behavioral economics is "bounded rationality," which acknowledges that people often make decisions based on limited information, time, or cognitive ability. For instance, individuals may rely on mental shortcuts, or heuristics, to simplify complex decisions, leading to errors like overestimating risks or underestimating long-term benefits. Similarly, "loss aversion" describes the tendency for people to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains, influencing everything from investment choices to consumer behavior.

                        Behavioral economics has practical applications in various fields, including public policy and marketing. Governments use "nudges," subtle interventions that encourage desired behaviors without restricting choice, to address societal challenges. For example, automatically enrolling employees in retirement savings plans has been shown to significantly increase participation rates. In marketing, companies leverage behavioral insights to influence consumer decisions, such as offering discounts framed as limited-time opportunities to create urgency.
