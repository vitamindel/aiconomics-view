                    <p class="section-description">
                        Environmental economics is a branch of economics that studies the relationship between economic activities and the environment. It focuses on understanding how economic decisions impact natural resources and ecosystems, while seeking ways to achieve sustainable development. By integrating environmental considerations into economic models, this field aims to address pressing challenges such as climate change, pollution, and resource depletion.

                    <p class="section-description">
                        One of the central concepts in environmental economics is the idea of externalities—costs or benefits of economic activities that are not reflected in market prices. For instance, pollution from factories imposes health and environmental costs on society, which are not borne by the producers or consumers directly involved. To address such market failures, environmental economists advocate for tools like carbon taxes, pollution permits, and subsidies for renewable energy, which help internalize these external costs.

                    <p class="section-description">
                        Environmental economics also emphasizes valuing natural resources and ecosystem services. Forests, for example, provide benefits such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and water filtration. Assigning economic value to these services helps policymakers recognize their importance and make informed decisions about land use, conservation, and development. This approach underpins initiatives like payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs, which incentivize sustainable practices among landowners and industries.
